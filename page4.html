    <h1>Planning your trip</h1>
    <h2>âœˆ By plane</h2>
    <p>This is the wisest choice for those who don't have time to waste. You can be in Rome from London in about 2.5 hours. There are so many air companies that fly to Ciampino, located near the city centre, or Fiumicino, Rome's biggest and busiest airport. Click on that <a href="https://rb.gy/czgqeg" target="_blank" rel="external">link</a> and buy your air tickets now.</p>
    <h2>ðŸš„ By train</h2>
    <p>If you have fear of airplanes, the train might be a solution for you. The train will take about one day from London to Rome, and you will pay up to 10 times more than an air ticket. But you will cross France, maybe also Switzerland depending on the route and Italy's countryside where you will see beautiful landscapes all the way. Click on that <a href="https://rb.gy/o4xovr" target="_blank" rel="external">link</a> to buy your tickets.</p>
    <h2>ðŸš™ By car</h2>
    <p>If you are really adventurous, then you drive to Rome! However you will have to do that at least for a couple of days because it's 1148 miles away from London. And you will need to pay toll costs, a lot of them, fuel and maybe a place to sleep before getting there. That can be your lifetime adventure, but your vehicle should be prepared.
