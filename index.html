<p>Rome (or Roma in Italian) is the capital of Italy and has a population of 2.8 million, the Romans. According to legend, Rome was founded by the twins Romulus and Remus in 753 BCE. The city is located on the banks of the river Tiber and was founded on top of seven hills. Particularly the area around Palatine Hill and Capitoline Hill would later become the centre of power of the enormous Roman Empire. </p>

<p>You can find many ruins and excavations here of the Forum Romanum and the Colosseum gives you an impression of how gladiators had to do battle in this enormous Roman amphitheatre. The Pantheon, which is now a church, has its characteristic round, open roof and is one of the best kept buildings from Roman times. And the Via Appia takes you back in time along one of the oldest roads of Rome Italy. Basically, the city of Rome is one giant museum. It is therefore no surprise that the complete historic city centre is on the UNESCO World Heritage List.</p>
